					<p>I am a PhD student of linguistics interested in the processes by which children acquire the structures of human language, such as sounds and grammar. I am also interested in the theories that explain language aquisition phenomena. My past research has focused to varied extents on the acquisition of multiple languages. As an undergraduate, I conducted original research on language differentiation in Spanish-English bilingual children, using phonetic cues in codemixed utterances. My MPhil dissertation compared the phonological characteristics of consonant clusters produced by toddlers acquiring English as a  second language to native speakers of a similar age. I have also participated in crosslinguistic acquisition research on recursive structures in English and Mandarin. </p>
					<p>Outside of academia, I love to travel and spend time with animals (especially birds), and learning new languages. I spent seven years of my life in Shanghai, China, and have also spent a significant amount of time in the US, UK, Spain, China, and now, Germany.</p>
					<p>I also maintain a personal blog, which I use to document my learning about other areas of linguistics/language that interest me.</p>
